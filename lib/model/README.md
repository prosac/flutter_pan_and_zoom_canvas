# A pseudo graph

I am well aware that what I am implementing here is not really a graph in all its flavors...
See for example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5668432/object-oriented-implementation-of-graph-data-structures

For now i do not need any graph algorithms to work on my bunch of nodes and connections.
